Out of box, Tableau provides some nice shapes to use as symbols or icons in your workbook

It also provides a means to add more shapes as you see fit, and indeed adding custom shapes can make many workbooks really shine.

This is a folder of KPI icons that can give a red-yellow-green icon set aside from the provided ones, with duplicate all-black icons included

To use: save locally to your machine in a folder (I call mine "KPI") and move that folder to Tableau's Shapes folder no yuor machine.
This is usually found at: \Documents\My Tableau Repository\Shapes

Bonus advice: The Materialize icon set avialable for free has served me wonderfully on many Tableau projects and can be implemented in a similar fashion after downloading the needed icon sets.
